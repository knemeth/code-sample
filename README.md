Samples from Katja's Abyss: Tactics - https://kiefjerky.itch.io/katjas-abyss-tactics
> arrays.hss 
> Since the scripting language for the engine the game is made in, the OHRRPGCE, doesn't include arrays, I created my own fake arrays by storing data in the screen position of invisible objects. The fake arrays are modeled after Python Lists, and are used in enemy AI, level generation, and various other systems in Katja's Abyss. 

> enemy.hss
> This includes the enemy behavior code for Katja's Abyss. Such behaviors involve pathfinding, choosing a target, attacking a target, and unique actions in specific conditions.

> animate.hss
> Katja's Abyss has many vfx that animate passively on screen, such as attack animations, menu visuals, particles, etc. This file manages each sprite intended to animate and applies the appropriate changes to them.
